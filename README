A simple Ruby app that downloads all tweets of a given screen name to a text file in the directory where it is executed.

Some things I plan on adding at some point:

- incremental updates to a file instead of loading everything from scratch each time
- finding URLs in each tweet and following them to their "exploded" form and storing those instead of shortened ones
- finding image links in each tweet and downloading them to a local folder
